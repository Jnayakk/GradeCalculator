# GradeCalculator
An android application that allows students from the University of Toronto to calculate their grades in an individual course or their overall GPA.

## Description
The UofT Grade Calculator Android app helps students calculate their grades easily. Students can either calculate their grades in any individual course by entering their assignment, midterm and final exam marks or they can calculate their overall grade point average by entering each course with their grades and their corresponding course weights. The GPA in this application based on the University of Toronto Grade Point Average scale which ranges from 0.00 (an F) to 4.00 (an A – A+). Below are some screen shots from the Grade Calculator App.

## How the calculations work
For each individual course, depending on how many assignments the user adds. To calculate the course average this application multiplies each grade with their corresponding weights achieved in the assignment, midterm and final exams to end up with the course average.

For the GPA, grade point values range from 0.00 (an F) to 4.00 (an A – A+). They are based off of the following chart which is why this app is exclusive to University of Toronto students.

## Why this app is so useful
This android application allows students from The University of Toronto to easily calculate their course grades or GPAs without the hassle of manually calculating each grade. Students can also calculate hypothetical grades by inputting marks they think they would achieve in order to see what results they would get. Being a UofT student myself I created this app so that it understands it's audience, and is designed for them.
